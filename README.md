# Once upon a time...
... I was part of a small group of friends who liked to visit demo scene parties. For those of you who don't know what this is, it's a LAN party where the focus is not on gaming but on (interactive) computer art. Google it if you want to know more about this phenomenon. 

# Surprise compo
Anyway... we were at a party in Germany, called The Ultimate Meeting, in 2006. As was tradition back then, the party also hosted a so called 'surprise compo' where we had a few hours to make an entry, during the party. This repository contains the result of a few hours of half drunk coding in the middle of the night. We ended up fourth place with it and were the only Mac demo.

# Code?
This is a recently updated version of the code we made back in 2006. It no longer compiled on a modern XCode and the old executable we had no longer runs on a 64-bit only operating system. The code is mostly Objective C and Objective C++ with a few bits of regular C++. It uses the (now deprecated) OpenGL graphics system for rendering graphics. This code is nowhere close to being production quality, so don't hold that against me! :)
